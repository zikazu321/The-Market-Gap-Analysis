# A. Executive Summary

This project analyzes the snack aisle to identify under-served opportunities for a healthier product launch using Open Food Facts data. After cleaning and categorizing 64,304 snack products across 14 high-level categories, the analysis found that only 5,952 products, or 9.3%, met the target definition of low sugar and high protein. The strongest market opportunity emerged in the **Spreads** category, which combines a high demand rate of 26.8% with only 10.6% of products currently meeting the healthy target-zone criteria. Based on these results, the recommended product direction is a **Spread** with **at least 10.0g of protein** and **less than 6.0g of sugar per 100g**, positioned in a category where demand already exists but healthy supply remains limited.

# C. Technical Explanation

## Data Cleaning
The dataset was cleaned by removing rows with missing or unusable values in the core fields required for analysis, especially product name, sugar, and protein. Biological bounds were applied to filter out impossible nutritional values, and non-snack or unclassifiable products were excluded so that the final dataset focused only on relevant snack products. The `categories_tags` field was then parsed and mapped into 14 readable high-level snack categories to make the analysis more interpretable and presentation-ready.

## Candidate’s Choice Addition
The additional feature I introduced was a **composite health score** and a **competitive benchmark shortlist**. The composite health score rewarded protein and fibre while penalizing sugar and fat, allowing categories and products to be compared more holistically beyond a simple sugar-versus-protein view. The benchmark shortlist then identified strong target-zone products already in the market, giving the R&D team practical examples to study for product formulation, nutritional positioning, and competitor benchmarking.

## Important Note on Code Submission

- Upload the `.ipynb` notebook file to the repository
- Also upload an **HTML or PDF export** of the notebook so the charts remain visible even if GitHub does not render the notebook properly
- Ensure the notebook, dashboard, and presentation links are all publicly accessible
- Once everything is confirmed, submit the links through the official submission form

# Project Brief: The "Sugar Trap" Market Gap Analysis

**Client:** Helix CPG Partners (Strategic Food & Beverage Consultancy)  
**Deliverable:** Interactive Dashboard, Code Notebook & Insight Presentation

---

## 1. Business Context
**Helix CPG Partners** advises major food manufacturers on new product development. Our newest client, a global snack manufacturer, wants to launch a "Healthy Snacking" line. They believe the market is oversaturated with sugary treats, but they lack the data to prove where the specific gaps are.

They have hired us to answer one question: **"Where is the 'Blue Ocean' in the snack aisle?"**

Specifically, they are looking for product categories that are currently under-served—areas where consumer demand for health (e.g., High Protein, High Fiber) is not being met by current product offerings (which are mostly High Sugar, High Fat).

## 2. The Data
You will use the **Open Food Facts** dataset, a free, open, and massive database of food products from around the world.

* **Source:** [Open Food Facts Data](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/data)
* **Format:** CSV (Comma Separated Values)
* **Warning:** The full dataset is massive (over 3GB). You are **not** expected to process the entire file. You should filter the data early or work with a manageable subset (e.g., the first 500,000 rows or specific categories).

## 3. Tooling Requirements
You have the flexibility to choose your development environment:

* **Option A (Recommended):** Use a cloud-hosted notebook like **Google Colab**, or **Deepnote**, etc.
* **Option B:** Use a local **Jupyter Notebook** or **VS Code**.
    * *Condition:* If you choose this, you must ensure your code is reproducible. Do not reference local file paths (e.g., `C:/Downloads/...`). Assume the dataset is in the same folder as your notebook.
* **Dashboarding:** The final output must be a **publicly accessible link** (e.g., Tableau Public, Google Looker Studio, Streamlit Cloud, or PowerBI Web).

## 4. User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

### Story 1: Data Ingestion & "The Clean Up"
**As a** Strategy Director,  
**I want** a clean dataset that removes products with erroneous nutritional information,  
**So that** my analysis is not skewed by bad data entry.

* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    * Handle missing values: Decide what to do with rows that have `null` or empty `sugars_100g`, `proteins_100g`, or `product_name`.
    * Handle outliers: Filter out biologically impossible values.
    * **Deliverable:** A cleaned Pandas DataFrame or SQL table export.

### Story 2: The Category Wrangler
**As a** Product Manager,  
**I want** to group products into readable high-level categories,  
**So that** I don't have to look at 10,000 unique, messy tags like `en:chocolate-chip-cookies-with-nuts`.

* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    * The `categories_tags` column is a comma-separated string (e.g., `en:snacks, en:sweet-snacks, en:biscuits`). You must parse this string.
    * Create a logic to assign a "Primary Category" to each product based on keywords.
    * Create at least 5 distinct high-level buckets.

### Story 3: The "Nutrient Matrix" Visualization
**As a** Marketing Lead,  
**I want** to see a Scatter Plot comparing Sugar (X-axis) vs. Protein (Y-axis) for different categories,  
**So that** I can visually spot where the products are clustered.

* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    * Create a dashboard (PowerBI, Tableau, Streamlit, or Python-based charts) displaying this relationship.
    * Allow the user to filter the chart by the "High Level Categories" you created in Story 2.
    * **Key Visual:** Identify the "Empty Quadrant" (e.g., High Protein + Low Sugar).

### Story 4: The Recommendation
**As a** Client,  
**I want** a clear text recommendation on what product we should build,  
**So that** I can take this to the R&D team.

* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    * On the dashboard, include a "Key Insight" box.
    * Complete this sentence: *"Based on the data, the biggest market opportunity is in [Category Name], specifically targeting products with [X]g of protein and less than [Y]g of sugar."*

## 5. Bonus User Story: The "Hidden Gem"
**As a** Health Conscious Consumer,  
**I want** to know which specific ingredients are driving the high protein content in the "good" products,  
**So that** I can replicate this in our new recipe.

* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    * Analyze the `ingredients_text` column for products in your "High Protein" cluster.
    * Extract and list the Top 3 most common protein sources (e.g., "Whey", "Peanuts", "Soy").

## 6. The "Candidate's Choice" Challenge
**As a** Creative Analyst,  
**I want** to add one additional feature or analysis to this project that I believe provides massive value,  
**So that** I can show off my business acumen.

* **Instructions:**
    * Add one more chart, filter, or metric that wasn't asked for.
    * Explain **why** you added it.
    * **There is no wrong answer, but you must justify your choice.**
